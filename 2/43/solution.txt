changing the order in this way causes `queen-cols` to be evaluated
`board-size` times instead of 1 time for each recursion; since there
are `board-size` levels of recursion, `queen-cols` will be evaluated
a total of `board-size` ^ `board-size` times.
the time required will be `board-size` ^ `board-size` T.
