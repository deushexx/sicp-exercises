1. partial-tree creates the balanced tree by dividing elts in ~half
   at each recursion, the first half makes the left subtree, 
   the first element of the second half is the entry of the current node
   and the remaining part of the second half makes the right subtree.
   So, the left subtree is generated recursively by (partial-tree elts x)
   where x is the length of the first half and `cdr` of the result will be fed
   to the same function to generate the right subtree; `cdr` of the result again
   will be given back to the caller to continue the recursion on the right.
