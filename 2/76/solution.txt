explicit dispatch:
    new operation:
        add dispatch
    new type:
        for each operation:
            modify dispatch

data-directed style:
    new operation:
        for each type:
            put operation
    new type:
        for each operation:
            put operation
        (but it's isolated when installing as a package)

message passing:
    new operation:
        for each type:
            modify dispatch
    new type:
        add dispatch

when new operations must often be added the best is explicit dispatch
when new types must often be added the best is either message passing data-directed style
